=============================
Ledoit-Wolf vs OAS estimation
=============================

The usual covariance maximum likelihood estimate can be regularized
using shrinkage. Ledoit and Wolf proposed a close formula to compute
the asymptotical optimal shrinkage parameter (minimizing a MSE
criterion), yielding the Ledoit-Wolf covariance estimate.

Chen et al. proposed an improvement of the Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage
parameter, the OAS coefficient, whose convergence is significantly
better under the assumption that the data are gaussian.

This example, inspired from Chen's publication [1], shows a comparison
of the estimated MSE of the LW and OAS methods, using gaussian
distributed data.
