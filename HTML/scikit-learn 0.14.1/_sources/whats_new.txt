---------

   - The :ref:`Working With Text Data <text_data_tutorial>` tutorial
     has now been worked in to the main documentation's tutorial section.
     Includes exercises and skeletons for tutorial presentation.
     Original tutorial created by several authors including
     `Olivier Grisel`_, Lars Buitinck and many others.
     Tutorial integration into the scikit-learn documentation
     by `Jaques Grobler`_

   - Added :class:`ensemble.BaggingClassifier` and
     :class:`ensemble.BaggingRegressor` meta-estimators for ensembling
     any kind of base estimator. See the :ref:`Bagging <bagging>` section of
     the user guide for details and examples. By `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - Memory improvements of decision trees, by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Decision trees can now be built in best-first manner by using ``max_leaf_nodes``
     as the stopping criteria. Refactored the tree code to use either a
     stack or a priority queue for tree building.
     By `Peter Prettenhofer`_ and `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - Decision trees can now be fitted on fortran- and c-style arrays, and
     non-continuous arrays without the need to make a copy.
     If the input array has a different dtype than ``np.float32``, a fortran-
     style copy will be made since fortran-style memory layout has speed
     advantages. By `Peter Prettenhofer`_ and `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - Speed improvement of regression trees by optimizing the
     the computation of the mean square error criterion. This lead
     to speed improvement of the tree, forest and gradient boosting tree
     modules. By `Arnaud Joly`_

   - Changed the internal storage of decision trees to use a struct array.
     This fixed some small bugs, while improving code and providing a small
     speed gain. By `Joel Nothman`_.

   - Reduce memory usage and overhead when fitting and predicting with forests
     of randomized trees in parallel with ``n_jobs != 1`` by leveraging new
     threading backend of joblib 0.8 and releasing the GIL in the tree fitting
     Cython code.  By `Olivier Grisel`_ and `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - Speed improvement of the :mod:`sklearn.ensemble.gradient_boosting` module.
     By `Gilles Louppe`_ and `Peter Prettenhofer`_.

   - Various enhancements to the  :mod:`sklearn.ensemble.gradient_boosting`
     module: a ``warm_start`` argument to fit additional trees,
     a ``max_leaf_nodes`` argument to fit GBM style trees,
     a ``monitor`` fit argument to inspect the estimator during training, and
     refactoring of the verbose code. By `Peter Prettenhofer`_.

   - Fixed bug in :class:`gradient_boosting.GradientBoostingRegressor` with
     ``loss='huber'``: ``gamma`` might have not been initialized.

   - Fixed feature importances as computed with a forest of randomized trees
     when fit with ``sample_weight != None`` and/or with ``bootstrap=True``.
     By `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - Added :func:`metrics.pairwise_distances_argmin_min`, by Philippe Gervais.

   - Added predict method to :class:`cluster.AffinityPropagation` and
     :class:`cluster.MeanShift`, by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Vector and matrix multiplications have been optimised throughout the
     library by `Denis Engemann`_, and `Alexandre Gramfort`_.
     In particular, they should take less memory with older NumPy versions
     (prior to 1.7.2).

   - New unsupervised feature selection algorithm
     :class:`feature_selection.VarianceThreshold`, by `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - Precision-recall and ROC examples now use train_test_split, and have more
     explanation of why these metrics are useful. By `Kyle Kastner`_

   - The training algorithm for :class:`decomposition.NMF` is faster for
     sparse matrices and has much lower memory complexity, meaning it will
     scale up gracefully to large datasets. By `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - Added svd_method option with default value to "randomized" to
     :class:`decomposition.factor_analysis.FactorAnalysis` to save memory and
     significantly speedup computation by `Denis Engemann`_, and
     `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - Changed :class:`cross_validation.StratifiedKFold` to try and
     preserve as much of the original ordering of samples as possible so as
     not to hide overfitting on datasets with a non-negligible level of
     samples dependency.
     By `Daniel Nouri`_ and `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - Add multi-output support to :class:`gaussian_process.GaussianProcess`
     by John Novak.

   - Norm computations optimized for NumPy 1.6 and later versions by
     `Lars Buitinck`_. In particular, the k-means algorithm no longer
     needs a temporary data structure the size of its input.

   - Added :class:`linear_model.RANSACRegressor` meta-estimator for the robust
     fitting of regression models. By Johannes Sch√∂nberger.

   - Added :ref:`Computational Performance <computational_performance>`
     documentation. Discussion and examples of prediction latency / throughput
     and different factors that have influence over speed. Additional tips for
     building faster models and choosing a relevant compromise between speed
     and predictive power.
     By `Eustache Diemert`_.

   - :class:`dummy.DummyClassifier` can now be used to predict a constant

   - Fixed bug in :class:`multiclass.OneVsOneClassifier` with string
     labels

   - Shorthand constructors :func:`pipeline.make_pipeline` and
     :func:`pipeline.make_union` were added by `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - Added :func:`learning_curve <learning_curve.learning_curve>` utility to
     chart performance with respect to training size. See
     :ref:`example_plot_learning_curve.py`. By `Alexander Fabisch`_.

   - Add positive option in :class:`LassoCV <linear_model.LassoCV>` and
     :class:`ElasticNetCV <linear_model.ElasticNetCV>`.
     By Brian Wignall and `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

     ``pre_dispatch != "all"`` (for instance in ``cross_val_score``).
     By `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - Added :class:`linear_model.MultiTaskElasticNetCV` and
     :class:`linear_model.MultiTaskLassoCV`. By `Manoj Kumar`_.

   - :mod:`sklearn.hmm` is deprecated. Its removal is planned
     for the 0.17 release.

   - Use of :class:`covariance.EllipticEnvelop` has now been removed after
     deprecation.
     Please use :class:`covariance.EllipticEnvelope` instead.

     :func:`feature_selection.f_regression` when variates are not centered.
     By `VirgileFritsch`_.


API changes summary
-------------------

   - Add score method to :class:`PCA <decomposition.PCA>` following the model of
     probabilistic PCA and deprecate
     :class:`ProbabilisticPCA <decomposition.ProbabilisticPCA>` model whose
     score implementation is not correct. The computation now also exploits the
     matrix inversion lemma for faster computation. By `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - The score method of :class:`FactorAnalysis <decomposition.FactorAnalysis>`
     now returns the average log-likelihood of the samples. Use score_samples
     to get log-likelihood of each sample. By `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - Generating boolean masks (the setting ``indices=False``)
     from cross-validation generators is deprecated.
     Support for masks will be removed in 0.17.
     The generators have produced arrays of indices by default since 0.10.
     By `Joel Nothman`_.

   - 1-d arrays containing strings with ``dtype=object`` (as used in Pandas)
     are now considered valid classification targets. This fixes a regression
     from version 0.13 in some classifiers. By `Joel Nothman`_.

   - Fix wrong `explained_variance_ratio_` attribute in
     :class:`RandomizedPCA <decomposition.RandomizedPCA>`.
     By `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - Fit alphas for each l1_ratio instead of mean_l1_ratio in
     :class: `linear_model.ElasticNetCV` and :class: `linear_model.LassoCV`.
     This changes the shape of alphas_ from (n_alphas,) to
     (n_l1_ratio, n_alphas) if the l1_ratio provided is a 1-D array like object
     of length greater than one.
     By `Manoj Kumar`_.

   - Fix :class:`linear_model.ElasticNetCV` and :class:`linear_model.LassoCV`
     when fitting intercept and X is sparse. The automatic grid
     of alphas was not computed correctly and the scaling with normalize
     was wrong. By `Manoj Kumar`_.

   - Fix wrong maximal number of features drawn (`max_features`) at each split
     for decision trees, random forests and gradient tree boosting.
     Previously, the count for the number of drawn features started only after
     one non constant features in the split. This bug fix will affect
     computational and generalization performance of those algorithms in the
     presence of constant features. To get back previous generalization
     performance, you should modify the value of `max_features`.
     By `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Fix wrong maximal number of features drawn (`max_features`) at each split
     for :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesClassifier` and
     :class:`ensemble.ExtraTreesRegressor`. Previously, only non constant
     features in the split was counted as drawn. Now constant features are
     counted as drawn. Furthermore at least one feature must be non constant
     in order to make a valid split. This bug fix will affect
     computational and generalization performance of extra trees in the
     presence of constant features. To get back previous generalization
     performance, you should modify the value of `max_features`.
     By `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Fix :func:`utils.compute_class_weight` when class_weight is "auto".
     Previously it was broken for input of non-int dtype and the weighted
     array that was returned was wrong. By `Manoj Kumar`_.

   - Fixed :mod:`sklearn.linear_model.stochastic_gradient.py` L2 regularization
     issue (minor practical significance).
     By `Norbert Crombach`_ and `Mathieu Blondel`_ .

   - Added an interactive version of `Andreas M√ºller`_'s
     `Machine Learning Cheat Sheet (for scikit-learn)
     <http://peekaboo-vision.blogspot.de/2013/01/machine-learning-cheat-sheet-for-scikit.html>`_
     to the documentation. See :ref:`Choosing the right estimator <ml_map>`.
     By `Jaques Grobler`_.

   - :class:`grid_search.GridSearchCV` and
     :func:`cross_validation.cross_val_score` now support the use of advanced
     scoring function such as area under the ROC curve and f-beta scores.

     and `Lars Buitinck`_.
     Passing a function from :mod:`sklearn.metrics` as ``score_func`` is
     deprecated.

   - Multi-label classification output is now supported by
     :func:`metrics.accuracy_score`, :func:`metrics.zero_one_loss`,
     :func:`metrics.f1_score`, :func:`metrics.fbeta_score`,

     :func:`metrics.precision_score` and :func:`metrics.recall_score`
     by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Two new metrics :func:`metrics.hamming_loss` and
     :func:`metrics.jaccard_similarity_score`
     are added with multi-label support by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Speed and memory usage improvements in
     :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer` and
     :class:`feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer`,
     by Jochen Wersd√∂rfer and Roman Sinayev.

   - The ``min_df`` parameter in
     :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer` and
     :class:`feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer`, which used to be 2,
     has been reset to 1 to avoid unpleasant surprises (empty vocabularies)
     for novice users who try it out on tiny document collections.
     A value of at least 2 is still recommended for practical use.

   - :class:`svm.LinearSVC`, :class:`linear_model.SGDClassifier` and
     :class:`linear_model.SGDRegressor` now have a ``sparsify`` method that
     converts their ``coef_`` into a sparse matrix, meaning stored models
     trained using these estimators can be made much more compact.

   - :class:`linear_model.SGDClassifier` now produces multiclass probability
     estimates when trained under log loss or modified Huber loss.

     :class:`tree.DecisionTreeRegressor` and all derived ensemble estimators
     now supports percentage values. By `Gilles Louppe`_.

     the fraction or the number of correctly classified sample
     by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Added :func:`metrics.log_loss` that computes log loss, aka cross-entropy
     loss. By Jochen Wersd√∂rfer and `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - A bug that caused :class:`ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier`'s to output
     incorrect probabilities has been fixed.

   - Feature selectors now share a mixin providing consistent `transform`,
     `inverse_transform` and `get_support` methods. By `Joel Nothman`_.

   - A fitted :class:`grid_search.GridSearchCV` or
     :class:`grid_search.RandomizedSearchCV` can now generally be pickled.
     By `Joel Nothman`_.

   - Refactored and vectorized implementation of :func:`metrics.roc_curve`
     and :func:`metrics.precision_recall_curve`. By `Joel Nothman`_.

   - The new estimator :class:`sklearn.decomposition.TruncatedSVD`
     performs dimensionality reduction using SVD on sparse matrices,
     and can be used for latent semantic analysis (LSA).
     By `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - Added self-contained example of out-of-core learning on text data
     :ref:`example_applications_plot_out_of_core_classification.py`.
     By `Eustache Diemert`_.

   - The default number of components for
     :class:`sklearn.decomposition.RandomizedPCA` is now correctly documented
     to be ``n_features``. This was the default behavior, so programs using it
     will continue to work as they did.

   - :class:`sklearn.cluster.KMeans` now fits several orders of magnitude
     faster on sparse data (the speedup depends on the sparsity). By
     `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - Reduce memory footprint of FastICA by `Denis Engemann`_ and
     `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - Verbose output in :mod:`sklearn.ensemble.gradient_boosting` now uses
     a column format and prints progress in decreasing frequency.
     It also shows the remaining time. By `Peter Prettenhofer`_.

   - :mod:`sklearn.ensemble.gradient_boosting` provides out-of-bag improvement
     :attr:`~sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor.oob_improvement_`
     rather than the OOB score for model selection. An example that shows
     how to use OOB estimates to select the number of trees was added.
     By `Peter Prettenhofer`_.

   - Most metrics now support string labels for multiclass classification
     by `Arnaud Joly`_ and `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - New OrthogonalMatchingPursuitCV class by `Alexandre Gramfort`_
     and `Vlad Niculae`_.

   - Fixed a bug in :class:`sklearn.covariance.GraphLassoCV`: the
     'alphas' parameter now works as expected when given a list of
     values. By Philippe Gervais.

   - Fixed an important bug in :class:`sklearn.covariance.GraphLassoCV`
     that prevented all folds provided by a CV object to be used (only
     the first 3 were used). When providing a CV object, execution
     time may thus increase significantly compared to the previous
     version (bug results are correct now). By Philippe Gervais.

   - :class:`cross_validation.cross_val_score` and the :mod:`grid_search`
     module is now tested with multi-output data by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - :func:`datasets.make_multilabel_classification` can now return
     the output in label indicator multilabel format  by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - K-nearest neighbors, :class:`neighbors.KNeighborsRegressor`
     and :class:`neighbors.RadiusNeighborsRegressor`,
     and radius neighbors, :class:`neighbors.RadiusNeighborsRegressor` and
     :class:`neighbors.RadiusNeighborsClassifier` support multioutput data
     by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Random state in LibSVM-based estimators (:class:`svm.SVC`, :class:`NuSVC`,
     :class:`OneClassSVM`, :class:`svm.SVR`, :class:`svm.NuSVR`) can now be
     controlled.  This is useful to ensure consistency in the probability
     estimates for the classifiers trained with ``probability=True``. By
     `Vlad Niculae`_.

   - Out-of-core learning support for discrete naive Bayes classifiers
     :class:`sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB` and
     :class:`sklearn.naive_bayes.BernoulliNB` by adding the ``partial_fit``
     method by `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - New website design and navigation by `Gilles Louppe`_, `Nelle Varoquaux`_,
     Vincent Michel and `Andreas M√ºller`_.

   - Improved documentation on :ref:`multi-class, multi-label and multi-output
     classification <multiclass>` by `Yannick Schwartz`_ and `Arnaud Joly`_.

API changes summary
-------------------

   - The :func:`auc_score` was renamed :func:`roc_auc_score`.

   - Testing scikit-learn with `sklearn.test()` is deprecated. Use
     `nosetest sklearn` from the command line.

   - Feature importances in :class:`tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`,
     :class:`tree.DecisionTreeRegressor` and all derived ensemble estimators
     are now computed on the fly when accessing  the ``feature_importances_``
     attribute. Setting ``compute_importances=True`` is no longer required.
     By `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - :class:`linear_model.lasso_path` and
     :class:`linear_model.enet_path` can return its results in the same
     format as that of :class:`linear_model.lars_path`. This is done by
     setting the `return_models` parameter to `False`. By
     `Jaques Grobler`_ and `Alexandre Gramfort`_

   - :class:`grid_search.IterGrid` was renamed to
     :class:`grid_search.ParameterGrid`.

   - Fixed bug in :class:`KFold` causing imperfect class balance in some
     cases. By `Alexandre Gramfort`_ and Tadej Jane≈æ.

   - :class:`sklearn.neighbors.BallTree` has been refactored, and a
     :class:`sklearn.neighbors.KDTree` has been
     added which shares the same interface.  The Ball Tree now works with
     a wide variety of distance metrics.  Both classes have many new
     methods, including single-tree and dual-tree queries, breadth-first
     and depth-first searching, and more advanced queries such as
     kernel density estimation and 2-point correlation functions.
     By `Jake Vanderplas`_

   - Support for scipy.spatial.cKDTree within neighbors queries has been
     removed, and the functionality replaced with the new :class:`KDTree`
     class.

   - :class:`sklearn.neighbors.KernelDensity` has been added, which performs
     efficient kernel density estimation with a variety of kernels.

   - :class:`sklearn.decomposition.KernelPCA` now always returns output with
     ``n_components`` components, unless the new parameter ``remove_zero_eig``
     is set to ``True``. This new behavior is consistent with the way
     kernel PCA was always documented; previously, the removal of components
     with zero eigenvalues was tacitly performed on all data.

   - ``gcv_mode="auto"`` no longer tries to perform SVD on a densified
     sparse matrix in :class:`sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV`.

   - Sparse matrix support in :class:`sklearn.decomposition.RandomizedPCA`
     is now deprecated in favor of the new ``TruncatedSVD``.

   - :class:`cross_validation.KFold` and
     :class:`cross_validation.StratifiedKFold` now enforce `n_folds >= 2`
     otherwise a ``ValueError`` is raised. By `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - :func:`datasets.load_files`'s ``charset`` and ``charset_errors``
     parameters were renamed ``encoding`` and ``decode_errors``.

   - Attribute ``oob_score_`` in :class:`sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`
     and :class:`sklearn.ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier`
     is deprecated and has been replaced by ``oob_improvement_`` .

   - Attributes in OrthogonalMatchingPursuit have been deprecated
     (copy_X, Gram, ...) and precompute_gram renamed precompute
     for consistency. See #2224.

   - :class:`sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` now converts integer input
     to float, and raises a warning. Previously it rounded for dense integer
     input.

   - :class:`sklearn.multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier` now has a
     ``decision_function`` method. This will return the distance of each
     sample from the decision boundary for each class, as long as the
     underlying estimators implement the ``decision_function`` method.
     By `Kyle Kastner`_.

   - Better input validation, warning on unexpected shapes for y.

Changelog
---------

   - :func:`metrics.zero_one_loss` (formerly ``metrics.zero_one``) now has
     option for normalized output that reports the fraction of
     misclassifications, rather than the raw number of misclassifications. By
     Kyle Beauchamp.

   - :class:`tree.DecisionTreeClassifier` and all derived ensemble models now

   - :class:`feature_selection.SelectPercentile` now breaks ties
     deterministically instead of returning all equally ranked features.

   - :class:`feature_selection.SelectKBest` and
     :class:`feature_selection.SelectPercentile` are more numerically stable
     since they use scores, rather than p-values, to rank results. This means
     that they might sometimes select different features than they did
     previously.

   - Ridge regression and ridge classification fitting with ``sparse_cg`` solver
     no longer has quadratic memory complexity, by `Lars Buitinck`_ and
     `Fabian Pedregosa`_.

   - Ridge regression and ridge classification now support a new fast solver

   - Speed up of :func:`metrics.precision_recall_curve` by Conrad Lee.

   - Added support for reading/writing svmlight files with pairwise
     preference attribute (qid in svmlight file format) in

     Conrad Lee.

   - New kernel :class:`metrics.chi2_kernel` by `Andreas M√ºller`_, often used
     in computer vision applications.

   - Fix of longstanding bug in :class:`naive_bayes.BernoulliNB` fixed by
     Shaun Jackman.

   - Implement `predict_proba` in :class:`multiclass.OneVsRestClassifier`, by
     Andrew Winterman.

   - Improve consistency in gradient boosting: estimators
     :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor` and
     :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` use the estimator
     :class:`tree.DecisionTreeRegressor` instead of the
     :class:`tree._tree.Tree` data structure by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Fixed a floating point exception in the :ref:`decision trees <tree>`
     module, by Seberg.

   - Fix :func:`metrics.roc_curve` fails when y_true has only one class
     by Wei Li.

   - Add the :func:`metrics.mean_absolute_error` function which computes the
     mean absolute error. The :func:`metrics.mean_squared_error`,
     :func:`metrics.mean_absolute_error` and
     :func:`metrics.r2_score` metrics support multioutput by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Fixed ``class_weight`` support in :class:`svm.LinearSVC` and
     :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` by `Andreas M√ºller`_. The meaning
     of ``class_weight`` was reversed as erroneously higher weight meant less
     positives of a given class in earlier releases.

   - Improve narrative documentation and consistency in
     :mod:`sklearn.metrics` for regression and classification metrics
     by `Arnaud Joly`_.

   - Fixed a bug in :class:`sklearn.svm.SVC` when using csr-matrices with
     unsorted indices by Xinfan Meng and `Andreas M√ºller`_.

   - :class:`MiniBatchKMeans`: Add random reassignment of cluster centers
     with little observations attached to them, by `Gael Varoquaux`_.


API changes summary
-------------------
   - Renamed all occurrences of ``n_atoms`` to ``n_components`` for consistency.
     This applies to :class:`decomposition.DictionaryLearning`,
     :class:`decomposition.MiniBatchDictionaryLearning`,
     :func:`decomposition.dict_learning`, :func:`decomposition.dict_learning_online`.

   - Renamed all occurrences of ``max_iters`` to ``max_iter`` for consistency.
     This applies to :class:`semi_supervised.LabelPropagation` and
     :class:`semi_supervised.label_propagation.LabelSpreading`.

   - Renamed all occurrences of ``learn_rate`` to ``learning_rate`` for
     consistency in :class:`ensemble.BaseGradientBoosting` and
     :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`.

   - The module ``sklearn.linear_model.sparse`` is gone. Sparse matrix support
     was already integrated into the "regular" linear models.

   - :func:`sklearn.metrics.mean_square_error`, which incorrectly returned the
     accumulated error, was removed. Use ``mean_squared_error`` instead.

   - Passing ``class_weight`` parameters to ``fit`` methods is no longer
     supported. Pass them to estimator constructors instead.

   - GMMs no longer have ``decode`` and ``rvs`` methods. Use the ``score``,
     ``predict`` or ``sample`` methods instead.

   - The ``solver`` fit option in Ridge regression and classification is now
     deprecated and will be removed in v0.14. Use the constructor option
     instead.

   - :class:`feature_extraction.text.DictVectorizer` now returns sparse
     matrices in the CSR format, instead of COO.

   - Renamed ``k`` in :class:`cross_validation.KFold` and
     :class:`cross_validation.StratifiedKFold` to ``n_folds``, renamed
     ``n_bootstraps`` to ``n_iter`` in ``cross_validation.Bootstrap``.

   - Renamed all occurrences of ``n_iterations`` to ``n_iter`` for consistency.
     This applies to :class:`cross_validation.ShuffleSplit`,
     :class:`cross_validation.StratifiedShuffleSplit`,
     :func:`utils.randomized_range_finder` and :func:`utils.randomized_svd`.

   - Replaced ``rho`` in :class:`linear_model.ElasticNet` and
     :class:`linear_model.SGDClassifier` by ``l1_ratio``. The ``rho`` parameter
     had different meanings; ``l1_ratio`` was introduced to avoid confusion.
     It has the same meaning as previously ``rho`` in
     :class:`linear_model.ElasticNet` and ``(1-rho)`` in
     :class:`linear_model.SGDClassifier`.

   - :class:`linear_model.LassoLars` and :class:`linear_model.Lars` now
     store a list of paths in the case of multiple targets, rather than
     an array of paths.

   - The attribute ``gmm`` of :class:`hmm.GMMHMM` was renamed to ``gmm_``
     to adhere more strictly with the API.

   - :func:`cluster.spectral_embedding` was moved to
     :func:`manifold.spectral_embedding`.

   - Renamed ``eig_tol`` in :func:`manifold.spectral_embedding`,
     :class:`cluster.SpectralClustering` to ``eigen_tol``, renamed ``mode``
     to ``eigen_solver``.

   - Renamed ``mode`` in :func:`manifold.spectral_embedding` and
     :class:`cluster.SpectralClustering` to ``eigen_solver``.

   - ``classes_`` and ``n_classes_`` attributes of
     :class:`tree.DecisionTreeClassifier` and all derived ensemble models are
     now flat in case of single output problems and nested in case of
     multi-output problems.

   - The ``estimators_`` attribute of
     :class:`ensemble.gradient_boosting.GradientBoostingRegressor` and
     :class:`ensemble.gradient_boosting.GradientBoostingClassifier` is now an
     array of :class:'tree.DecisionTreeRegressor'.

   - Renamed ``chunk_size`` to ``batch_size`` in
     :class:`decomposition.MiniBatchDictionaryLearning` and
     :class:`decomposition.MiniBatchSparsePCA` for consistency.

   - :class:`svm.SVC` and :class:`svm.NuSVC` now provide a ``classes_``
     attribute and support arbitrary dtypes for labels ``y``.
     Also, the dtype returned by ``predict`` now reflects the dtype of
     ``y`` during ``fit`` (used to be ``np.float``).

   - Changed default test_size in :func:`cross_validation.train_test_split`
     to None, added possibility to infer ``test_size`` from ``train_size`` in
     :class:`cross_validation.ShuffleSplit` and
     :class:`cross_validation.StratifiedShuffleSplit`.

   - Renamed function :func:`sklearn.metrics.zero_one` to
     :func:`sklearn.metrics.zero_one_loss`. Be aware that the default behavior
     in :func:`sklearn.metrics.zero_one_loss` is different from
     :func:`sklearn.metrics.zero_one`: ``normalize=False`` is changed to
     ``normalize=True``.

   - Renamed function :func:`metrics.zero_one_score` to
     :func:`metrics.accuracy_score`.

   - :func:`datasets.make_circles` now has the same number of inner and outer points.

   - In the Naive Bayes classifiers, the ``class_prior`` parameter was moved
     from ``fit`` to ``__init__``.

Changelog
---------

   - Various speed improvements of the :ref:`decision trees <tree>` module, by
     `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor` and
     :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` now support feature subsampling
     via the ``max_features`` argument, by `Peter Prettenhofer`_.

   - Added Huber and Quantile loss functions to
     :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingRegressor`, by `Peter Prettenhofer`_.

   - :ref:`Decision trees <tree>` and :ref:`forests of randomized trees <forest>`
     now support multi-output classification and regression problems, by
     `Gilles Louppe`_.

   - Added :class:`preprocessing.LabelEncoder`, a simple utility class to
     normalize labels or transform non-numerical labels, by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Added the epsilon-insensitive loss and the ability to make probabilistic
     predictions with the modified huber loss in :ref:`sgd`, by
     `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Added :ref:`multidimensional_scaling`, by Nelle Varoquaux.

   - SVMlight file format loader now detects compressed (gzip/bzip2) files and
     decompresses them on the fly, by `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - SVMlight file format serializer now preserves double precision floating
     point values, by `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - A common testing framework for all estimators was added, by `Andreas M√ºller`_.

   - Understandable error messages for estimators that do not accept
     sparse input by `Gael Varoquaux`_

   - Speedups in hierarchical clustering by `Gael Varoquaux`_. In
     particular building the tree now supports early stopping. This is
     useful when the number of clusters is not small compared to the
     number of samples.

   - Add MultiTaskLasso and MultiTaskElasticNet for joint feature selection,
     by `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - Added :func:`metrics.auc_score` and
     :func:`metrics.average_precision_score` convenience functions by `Andreas
     M√ºller`_.

   - Improved sparse matrix support in the :ref:`feature_selection`

   - New word boundaries-aware character n-gram analyzer for the
     :ref:`text_feature_extraction` module by `@kernc`_.

   - Fixed bug in spectral clustering that led to single point clusters
     by `Andreas M√ºller`_.

   - In :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`, added an option to

     `Alexandre Gramfort`_.

   - Fixes in :class:`decomposition.ProbabilisticPCA` score function by Wei Li.

   - Fixed feature importance computation in
     :ref:`gradient_boosting`.

API changes summary
-------------------

   - The old ``scikits.learn`` package has disappeared; all code should import
     from ``sklearn`` instead, which was introduced in 0.9.

   - In :func:`metrics.roc_curve`, the ``thresholds`` array is now returned
     with it's order reversed, in order to keep it consistent with the order
     of the returned ``fpr`` and ``tpr``.

   - In :class:`hmm` objects, like :class:`hmm.GaussianHMM`,
     :class:`hmm.MultinomialHMM`, etc., all parameters must be passed to the
     object when initialising it and not through ``fit``. Now ``fit`` will
     only accept the data as an input parameter.

   - For all SVM classes, a faulty behavior of ``gamma`` was fixed. Previously,
     the default gamma value was only computed the first time ``fit`` was called
     and then stored. It is now recalculated on every call to ``fit``.

   - All ``Base`` classes are now abstract meta classes so that they can not be
     instantiated.

   - :func:`cluster.ward_tree` now also returns the parent array. This is
     necessary for early-stopping in which case the tree is not
     completely built.

   - In :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer` the parameters
     ``min_n`` and ``max_n`` were joined to the parameter ``n_gram_range`` to
     enable grid-searching both at once.

   - In :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer`, words that appear
     only in one document are now ignored by default. To reproduce
     the previous behavior, set ``min_df=1``.

   - Fixed API inconsistency: :meth:`linear_model.SGDClassifier.predict_proba` now
     returns 2d array when fit on two classes.

   - Fixed API inconsistency: :meth:`qda.QDA.decision_function` and
     :meth:`lda.LDA.decision_function` now return 1d arrays when fit on two
     classes.

   - Grid of alphas used for fitting :class:`linear_model.LassoCV` and
     :class:`linear_model.ElasticNetCV` is now stored
     in the attribute `alphas_` rather than overriding the init parameter
     `alphas`.

   - Linear models when alpha is estimated by cross-validation store
     the estimated value in the `alpha_` attribute rather than just
     `alpha` or `best_alpha`.

   - :class:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier` now supports
     :meth:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.staged_predict_proba`, and
     :meth:`ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier.staged_predict`.

   - :class:`svm.sparse.SVC` and other sparse SVM classes are now deprecated.
     The all classes in the :ref:`svm` module now automatically select the
     sparse or dense representation base on the input.

   - All clustering algorithms now interpret the array ``X`` given to ``fit`` as
     input data, in particular :class:`cluster.SpectralClustering` and
     :class:`cluster.AffinityPropagation` which previously expected affinity matrices.

   - For clustering algorithms that take the desired number of clusters as a parameter,
     this parameter is now called ``n_clusters``.

     :func:`metrics.precision_score`, :func:`metrics.recall_score` and
     :func:`metrics.f1_score` by `Satrajit Ghosh`_.

   - :ref:`out_of_bag` of generalization error for :ref:`ensemble`
     by `Andreas M√ºller`_.

   - :ref:`randomized_l1`: Randomized sparse linear models for feature
     selection, by `Alexandre Gramfort`_ and `Gael Varoquaux`_

   - :ref:`label_propagation` for semi-supervised learning, by Clay
     Woolam. **Note** the semi-supervised API is still work in progress,
     and may change.

   - Added BIC/AIC model selection to classical :ref:`gmm` and unified
     the API with the remainder of scikit-learn, by `Bertrand Thirion`_

     a :class:`sklearn.cross_validation.ShuffleSplit` with balanced splits,
     by Yannick Schwartz.

   - :class:`sklearn.neighbors.NearestCentroid` classifier added, along with a
     ``shrink_threshold`` parameter, which implements **shrunken centroid
     classification**, by `Robert Layton`_.

Other changes
..............

   - Merged dense and sparse implementations of :ref:`sgd` module and
     exposed utility extension types for sequential
     datasets `seq_dataset` and weight vectors `weight_vector`
     by `Peter Prettenhofer`_.

   - Added `partial_fit` (support for online/minibatch learning) and
     warm_start to the :ref:`sgd` module by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Dense and sparse implementations of :ref:`svm` classes and
     :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` merged by `Lars Buitinck`_.

   - Regressors can now be used as base estimator in the :ref:`multiclass`
     module by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - Added n_jobs option to :func:`metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances`
     and :func:`metrics.pairwise.pairwise_kernels` for parallel computation,
     by `Mathieu Blondel`_.

   - :ref:`k_means` can now be run in parallel, using the `n_jobs` argument
     to either :ref:`k_means` or :class:`KMeans`, by `Robert Layton`_.

   - Improved :ref:`cross_validation` and :ref:`grid_search` documentation
     and introduced the new :func:`cross_validation.train_test_split`
     helper function by `Olivier Grisel`_

   - :class:`svm.SVC` members `coef_` and `intercept_` changed sign for consistency
     with `decision_function`; for ``kernel==linear``, `coef_` was fixed
     in the the one-vs-one case, by `Andreas M√ºller`_.

   - Performance improvements to efficient leave-one-out cross-validated
     Ridge regression, esp. for the ``n_samples > n_features`` case, in
     :class:`linear_model.RidgeCV`, by Reuben Fletcher-Costin.

   - Refactoring and simplification of the :ref:`text_feature_extraction`
     API and fixed a bug that caused possible negative IDF,
     by `Olivier Grisel`_.

   - Beam pruning option in :class:`_BaseHMM` module has been removed since it
     is difficult to Cythonize. If you are interested in contributing a Cython
     version, you can use the python version in the git history as a reference.

   - Classes in :ref:`neighbors` now support arbitrary Minkowski metric for
     nearest neighbors searches. The metric can be specified by argument ``p``.

API changes summary
-------------------

   - :class:`covariance.EllipticEnvelop` is now deprecated - Please use :class:`covariance.EllipticEnvelope`
     instead.

   - `NeighborsClassifier` and `NeighborsRegressor` are gone in the module
     :ref:`neighbors`. Use the classes :class:`KNeighborsClassifier`,
     :class:`RadiusNeighborsClassifier`, :class:`KNeighborsRegressor`
     and/or :class:`RadiusNeighborsRegressor` instead.

   - Sparse classes in the :ref:`sgd` module are now deprecated.

   - In :class:`mixture.GMM`, :class:`mixture.DPGMM` and :class:`mixture.VBGMM`,
     parameters must be passed to an object when initialising it and not through
     ``fit``. Now ``fit`` will only accept the data as an input parameter.

   - methods `rvs` and `decode` in :class:`GMM` module are now deprecated.
     `sample` and `score` or `predict` should be used instead.

   - attribute `_scores` and `_pvalues` in univariate feature selection
     objects are now deprecated.
     `scores_` or `pvalues_` should be used instead.

   - In :class:`LogisticRegression`, :class:`LinearSVC`, :class:`SVC` and
     :class:`NuSVC`, the `class_weight` parameter is now an initialization
     parameter, not a parameter to fit. This makes grid searches
     over this parameter possible.

   - LFW ``data`` is now always shape ``(n_samples, n_features)`` to be
     consistent with the Olivetti faces dataset. Use ``images`` and
     ``pairs`` attribute to access the natural images shapes instead.

   - In :class:`svm.LinearSVC`, the meaning of the `multi_class` parameter changed.
     Options now are 'ovr' and 'crammer_singer', with 'ovr' being the default.
     This does not change the default behavior but hopefully is less confusing.

   - Class :class:`feature_selection.text.Vectorizer` is deprecated and
     replaced by :class:`feature_selection.text.TfidfVectorizer`.

   - The preprocessor / analyzer nested structure for text feature
     extraction has been removed. All those features are
     now directly passed as flat constructor arguments
     to :class:`feature_selection.text.TfidfVectorizer` and
     :class:`feature_selection.text.CountVectorizer`, in particular the
     following parameters are now used:

       - ``analyzer`` can be `'word'` or `'char'` to switch the default
         analysis scheme, or use a specific python callable (as previously).

       - ``tokenizer`` and ``preprocessor`` have been introduced to make it
         still possible to customize those steps with the new API.

       - ``input`` explicitly control how to interpret the sequence passed to
         ``fit`` and ``predict``: filenames, file objects or direct (byte or
         Unicode) strings.

       - charset decoding is explicit and strict by default.

       - the ``vocabulary``, fitted or not is now stored in the
         ``vocabulary_`` attribute to be consistent with the project
         conventions.

   - Class :class:`feature_selection.text.TfidfVectorizer` now derives directly
     from :class:`feature_selection.text.CountVectorizer` to make grid
     search trivial.

   - methods `rvs` in :class:`_BaseHMM` module are now deprecated.
     `sample` should be used instead.

   - Beam pruning option in :class:`_BaseHMM` module is removed since it is
     difficult to be Cythonized. If you are interested, you can look in the
     history codes by git.

   - The SVMlight format loader now supports files with both zero-based and
     one-based column indices, since both occur "in the wild".

   - Arguments in class :class:`ShuffleSplit` are now consistent with
     :class:`StratifiedShuffleSplit`. Arguments ``test_fraction`` and
     ``train_fraction`` are deprecated and renamed to ``test_size`` and
     ``train_size`` and can accept both ``float`` and ``int``.

   - Arguments in class :class:`Bootstrap` are now consistent with
     :class:`StratifiedShuffleSplit`. Arguments ``n_test`` and
     ``n_train`` are deprecated and renamed to ``test_size`` and
     ``train_size`` and can accept both ``float`` and ``int``.

   - Argument ``p`` added to classes in :ref:`neighbors` to specify an
     arbitrary Minkowski metric for nearest neighbors searches.

API changes summary
-------------------

Here are the code migration instructions when upgrading from scikit-learn
version 0.9:

  - Some estimators that may overwrite their inputs to save memory previously
    had ``overwrite_`` parameters; these have been replaced with ``copy_``
    parameters with exactly the opposite meaning.

    This particularly affects some of the estimators in :mod:`linear_model`.
    The default behavior is still to copy everything passed in.

  - The SVMlight dataset loader :func:`sklearn.datasets.load_svmlight_file` no
    longer supports loading two files at once; use ``load_svmlight_files``
    instead. Also, the (unused) ``buffer_mb`` parameter is gone.

  - Sparse estimators in the :ref:`sgd` module use dense parameter vector
    ``coef_`` instead of ``sparse_coef_``. This significantly improves
    test time performance.

  - The :ref:`covariance` module now has a robust estimator of
    covariance, the Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator.

  - Cluster evaluation metrics in :mod:`metrics.cluster` have been refactored
    but the changes are backwards compatible. They have been moved to the
    :mod:`metrics.cluster.supervised`, along with
    :mod:`metrics.cluster.unsupervised` which contains the Silhouette
    Coefficient.

  - The ``permutation_test_score`` function now behaves the same way as
    ``cross_val_score`` (i.e. uses the mean score across the folds.)

  - Cross Validation generators now use integer indices (``indices=True``)
    by default instead of boolean masks. This make it more intuitive to
    use with sparse matrix data.

  - The functions used for sparse coding, ``sparse_encode`` and
    ``sparse_encode_parallel`` have been combined into
    :func:`sklearn.decomposition.sparse_encode`, and the shapes of the arrays
    have been transposed for consistency with the matrix factorization setting,
    as opposed to the regression setting.

  - Fixed an off-by-one error in the SVMlight/LibSVM file format handling;
    files generated using :func:`sklearn.datasets.dump_svmlight_file` should be
    re-generated. (They should continue to work, but accidentally had one
    extra column of zeros prepended.)

  - ``BaseDictionaryLearning`` class replaced by ``SparseCodingMixin``.

  - :func:`sklearn.utils.extmath.fast_svd` has been renamed
    :func:`sklearn.utils.extmath.randomized_svd` and the default
    oversampling is now fixed to 10 additional random vectors instead
    of doubling the number of components to extract. The new behavior
    follows the reference paper.

API changes summary
-------------------

Here are the code migration instructions when upgrading from scikit-learn
version 0.8:

  - The ``scikits.learn`` package was renamed ``sklearn``. There is
    still a ``scikits.learn`` package alias for backward compatibility.

    Third-party projects with a dependency on scikit-learn 0.9+ should
    upgrade their codebase. For instance under Linux / MacOSX just run
    (make a backup first!)::

      find -name "*.py" | xargs sed -i 's/\bscikits.learn\b/sklearn/g'

  - Estimators no longer accept model parameters as ``fit`` arguments:
    instead all parameters must be only be passed as constructor
    arguments or using the now public ``set_params`` method inherited
    from :class:`base.BaseEstimator`.

    Some estimators can still accept keyword arguments on the ``fit``
    but this is restricted to data-dependent values (e.g. a Gram matrix
    or an affinity matrix that are precomputed from the ``X`` data matrix.

  - The ``cross_val`` package has been renamed to ``cross_validation``
    although there is also a ``cross_val`` package alias in place for
    backward compatibility.

    Third-party projects with a dependency on scikit-learn 0.9+ should
    upgrade their codebase. For instance under Linux / MacOSX just run
    (make a backup first!)::

      find -name "*.py" | xargs sed -i 's/\bcross_val\b/cross_validation/g'

  - The ``score_func`` argument of the
    ``sklearn.cross_validation.cross_val_score`` function is now expected
    to accept ``y_test`` and ``y_predicted`` as only arguments for
    classification and regression tasks or ``X_test`` for unsupervised
    estimators.

  - ``gamma`` parameter for support vector machine algorithms is set
    to ``1 / n_features`` by default, instead of ``1 / n_samples``.

  - The ``sklearn.hmm`` has been marked as orphaned: it will be removed
    from scikit-learn in version 0.11 unless someone steps up to
    contribute documentation, examples and fix lurking numerical
    stability issues.

  - ``sklearn.neighbors`` has been made into a submodule.  The two previously
    available estimators, ``NeighborsClassifier`` and ``NeighborsRegressor``
    have been marked as deprecated.  Their functionality has been divided
    among five new classes: ``NearestNeighbors`` for unsupervised neighbors
    searches, ``KNeighborsClassifier`` & ``RadiusNeighborsClassifier``
    for supervised classification problems, and ``KNeighborsRegressor``
    & ``RadiusNeighborsRegressor`` for supervised regression problems.

  - ``sklearn.ball_tree.BallTree`` has been moved to
    ``sklearn.neighbors.BallTree``.  Using the former will generate a warning.

  - ``sklearn.linear_model.LARS()`` and related classes (LassoLARS,
    LassoLARSCV, etc.) have been renamed to
    ``sklearn.linear_model.Lars()``.

  - All distance metrics and kernels in ``sklearn.metrics.pairwise`` now have a Y
    parameter, which by default is None. If not given, the result is the distance
    (or kernel similarity) between each sample in Y. If given, the result is the
    pairwise distance (or kernel similarity) between samples in X to Y.

  - ``sklearn.metrics.pairwise.l1_distance`` is now called ``manhattan_distance``,
    and by default returns the pairwise distance. For the component wise distance,
    set the parameter ``sum_over_features`` to ``False``.

Backward compatibility package aliases and other deprecated classes and
functions will be removed in version 0.11.

.. _changes_0_8:

0.8
===

.. _changes_0_6:

0.6
===

scikit-learn 0.6 was released on December 2010. It is marked by the
inclusion of several new modules and a general renaming of old
ones. It is also marked by the inclusion of new example, including
applications to real-world datasets.


Changelog
---------

  - New `stochastic gradient
    <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/sgd.html>`_ descent
    module by Peter Prettenhofer. The module comes with complete
    documentation and examples.

  - Improved svm module: memory consumption has been reduced by 50%,
    heuristic to automatically set class weights, possibility to
    assign weights to samples (see
    :ref:`example_svm_plot_weighted_samples.py` for an example).

  - New :ref:`gaussian_process` module by Vincent Dubourg. This module
    also has great documentation and some very neat examples. See
    :ref:`example_gaussian_process_plot_gp_regression.py` or
    :ref:`example_gaussian_process_plot_gp_probabilistic_classification_after_regression.py`
    for a taste of what can be done.

  - It is now possible to use liblinear‚Äôs Multi-class SVC (option
    multi_class in :class:`svm.LinearSVC`)

  - New features and performance improvements of text feature
    extraction.

  - Improved sparse matrix support, both in main classes
    (:class:`grid_search.GridSearchCV`) as in modules
    sklearn.svm.sparse and sklearn.linear_model.sparse.

  - Lots of cool new examples and a new section that uses real-world
    datasets was created. These include:
    :ref:`example_applications_face_recognition.py`,
    :ref:`example_applications_plot_species_distribution_modeling.py`,
    :ref:`example_applications_svm_gui.py`,
    :ref:`example_applications_wikipedia_principal_eigenvector.py` and
    others.

  - Faster :ref:`least_angle_regression` algorithm. It is now 2x
    faster than the R version on worst case and up to 10x times faster
    on some cases.

  - Faster coordinate descent algorithm. In particular, the full path
    version of lasso (:func:`linear_model.lasso_path`) is more than
    200x times faster than before.

  - It is now possible to get probability estimates from a
    :class:`linear_model.LogisticRegression` model.

  - module renaming: the glm module has been renamed to linear_model,
    the gmm module has been included into the more general mixture
    model and the sgd module has been included in linear_model.

  - Lots of bug fixes and documentation improvements.

      narrative documentation from the class reference. As an example,
      see `documentation for the SVM module
      <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/svm.html>`_ and the
      complete `class reference
      <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html>`_.

Fixes
-----

    - API changes: adhere variable names to PEP-8, give more
      meaningful names.

    - Fixes for svm module to run on a shared memory context
      (multiprocessing).

    - It is again possible to generate latex (and thus PDF) from the
      sphinx docs.

Examples
--------

    - new examples using some of the mlcomp datasets:
      :ref:`example_mlcomp_sparse_document_classification.py`,
      :ref:`example_document_classification_20newsgroups.py`

    - Many more examples. `See here
      <http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/index.html>`_
      the full list of examples.


External dependencies
---------------------

    - Joblib is now a dependency of this package, although it is
      shipped with (sklearn.externals.joblib).

Removed modules
---------------

    - Module ann (Artificial Neural Networks) has been removed from
      the distribution. Users wanting this sort of algorithms should
      take a look into pybrain.

Misc
----

    - New sphinx theme for the web page.
