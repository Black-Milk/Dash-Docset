Scikit-learn provides a toolbox with solid implementations of a bunch of
state-of-the-art models and makes it easy to plug them into existing
applications. We've been using it quite a lot for music recommendations at
Spotify and I think it's the most well-designed ML package I've seen so
far.

.. title Scikit-learn for efficient and easier machine learning research
.. Author: Gaël Varoquaux


At INRIA, we use scikit-learn to support leading-edge basic research in many
teams: `Parietal <https://team.inria.fr/parietal/>`_ for neuroimaging, `Lear
<http://lear.inrialpes.fr/>`_ for computer vision, `Visages
<https://www.irisa.fr/visages/index>`_ for medical image analysis, `Privatics
<https://team.inria.fr/privatics>`_ for security. The project is a fantastic
tool to address difficult applications of machine learing in an academic
environment as it is performant and versatile, but all easy-to-use and well
documented, which makes it well suited to grad students.

Building a classifier is typically an iterative process of exploring
the data, selecting the features (the attributes of the data believed
to be predictive in some way), training the models, and finally
evaluating them. For many of these tasks, we relied on the excellent
scikit-learn package for Python.

At Telecom ParisTech, scikit-learn is used for hands-on sessions and home
assignments in introductory and advanced machine learning courses. The classes
are for undergrads and masters students. The great benefit of scikit-learn is
its fast learning curve that allows students to quickly start working on
interesting and motivating problems.

The scikit-learn toolkit is indispensable for the Data Analysis and Management
team at AWeber.  It allows us to do AWesome stuff we would not otherwise have
the time or resources to accomplish. The documentation is excellent, allowing
new engineers to quickly evaluate and apply many different algorithms to our
data. The text feature extraction utilities are useful when working with the
large volume of email content we have at AWeber. The RandomizedPCA
implementation, along with Pipelining and FeatureUnions, allows us to develop
complex machine learning algorithms efficiently and reliably.

Anyone interested in learning more about how AWeber deploys scikit-learn in a
production environment should check out talks from PyData Boston by AWeber's
Michael Becker available at https://github.com/mdbecker/pydata_2013

The combination of consistent APIs, thorough documentation, and top notch
implementation make scikit-learn our favorite machine learning package in
Python. scikit-learn makes doing advanced analysis in Python accessible to
anyone. At Yhat, we make it easy to integrate these models into your production
applications. Thus eliminating the unnecessary dev time encountered
productionizing analytical work.

The Python scikit-learn toolkit is a core tool in the data science
group at Rangespan. Its large collection of well documented models and
algorithms allow our team of data scientists to prototype fast and
quickly iterate to find the right solution to our learning problems.
We find that scikit-learn is not only the right tool for prototyping,
but its careful and well tested implementation give us the confidence
to run scikit-learn models in production.

At Birchbox, we face a range of machine learning problems typical to
E-commerce: product recommendation, user clustering, inventory prediction,
trends detection, etc. Scikit-learn lets us experiment with many models,
especially in the exploration phase of a new project: the data can be passed
around in a consistent way; models are easy to save and reuse; updates keep us
informed of new developments from the pattern discovery research community.
Scikit-learn is an important tool for our team, built the right way in the
right language.

Scikit-learn is our #1 toolkit for all things machine learning
at Bestofmedia. We use it for a variety of tasks (e.g. spam fighting,
ad click prediction, various ranking models) thanks to the varied,
state-of-the-art algorithm implementations packaged into it.
In the lab it accelerates prototyping of complex pipelines. In
production I can say it has proven to be robust and efficient enough
to be deployed for business critical components.

At change.org we automate the use of scikit-learn's RandomForestClassifier
in our production systems to drive email targeting that reaches millions
of users across the world each week. In the lab, scikit-learn's ease-of-use,
performance, and overall variety of algorithms implemented has proved invaluable
in giving us a single reliable source to turn to for our machine-learning needs.

At PHIMECA Engineering, we use scikit-learn estimators as surrogates for
expensive-to-evaluate numerical models (mostly but not exclusively
finite-element mechanical models) for speeding up the intensive post-processing
operations involved in our simulation-based decision making framework.
Scikit-learn's fit/predict API together with its efficient cross-validation
tools considerably eases the task of selecting the best-fit estimator. We are
also using scikit-learn for illustrating concepts in our training sessions.
Trainees are always impressed by the ease-of-use of scikit-learn despite the
apparent theoretical complexity of machine learning.

At HowAboutWe, scikit-learn lets us implement a wide array of machine learning
techniques in analysis and in production, despite having a small team.  We use
scikit-learn’s classification algorithms to predict user behavior, enabling us
to (for example) estimate the value of leads from a given traffic source early
in the lead’s tenure on our site. Also, our users' profiles consist of
primarily unstructured data (answers to open-ended questions), so we use
scikit-learn’s feature extraction and dimensionality reduction tools to
translate these unstructured data into inputs for our matchmaking system.

At PeerIndex we use scientific methodology to build the Influence Graph - a
unique dataset that allows us to identify who’s really influential and in which
context. To do this, we have to tackle a range of machine learning and
predictive modeling problems. Scikit-learn has emerged as our primary tool for
developing prototypes and making quick progress. From predicting missing data
and classifying tweets to clustering communities of social media users, scikit-
learn proved useful in a variety of applications. Its very intuitive interface
and excellent compatibility with other python tools makes it and indispensable
tool in our daily research efforts.
